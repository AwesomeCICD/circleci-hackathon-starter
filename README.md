# CircleCI Hackathon Starter

**Redesign the SDLC with CircleCI** - Build an AI-powered solution that fundamentally reimagines 1-2 phases of the Software Development Lifecycle, with CircleCI as the orchestration backbone.

This starter repository helps you quickly deploy your hackathon project using CircleCI with minimal configuration.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get your project running in 5 minutes:

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Sign up for CircleCI** at https://circleci.com/signup/ and connect your GitHub account
3. **Follow your repository** in CircleCI to enable the pipeline
4. **Push your code** - CircleCI will automatically run tests
5. **Choose a deployment target** (optional) - Uncomment one of the cloud deployment options in `.circleci/config.yml`

Your first build should pass immediately with the default configuration!

## üì¶ What This Repository Contains

### Working Components

- **Flask Application** (`app.py`) - A simple "Hello World" app with health check endpoint
- **CircleCI Pipeline** (`.circleci/config.yml`) - Pre-configured to run tests automatically
- **Dockerfile** - Ready for containerized deployments
- **Test Suite** - Basic validation that runs on every commit

### Deployment Examples

Three complete deployment configurations in the `examples/` folder:

- `deploy-to-aws.yml` - Deploy to AWS Lambda
- `deploy-to-gcp.yml` - Deploy to Google Cloud Run  
- `deploy-to-azure.yml` - Deploy to Azure Functions

### Helper Scripts

- `scripts/setup.sh` - Validates your config and shows required environment variables
- `scripts/validate.sh` - Quick validation of your CircleCI configuration

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è How to Choose Your Deployment Target

Pick the cloud platform that fits your project:

| Platform | Best For | Deployment Type |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **AWS Lambda** | Serverless functions, event-driven apps | Function as a Service |
| **GCP Cloud Run** | Containerized apps, microservices | Container as a Service |
| **Azure Functions** | Azure ecosystem, enterprise integration | Function as a Service |

### To Deploy:

1. Copy the example config to `.circleci/config.yml`:
   ```bash
   cp examples/deploy-to-aws.yml .circleci/config.yml
   ```

2. Set environment variables in CircleCI (see next section)

3. Push to the `main` branch - deployment happens automatically!

## üß™ Testing Your Pipeline

### Local Validation

Run the setup script to validate your configuration:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

Or use the quick validator:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

### Triggering Builds

CircleCI automatically runs on:
- Every push to any branch
- Every pull request

To manually trigger a build:
1. Go to your CircleCI dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Trigger Pipeline"

### Viewing Build Status

- **CircleCI Dashboard**: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/YOUR_USERNAME
- **Add a badge** to your README (see `SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md`)

## üìù Submission Requirements

Before submitting your project:

1. **Add a CircleCI badge** to your README showing build status
2. **Provide API proof** of deployment via CircleCI status endpoint
3. **Document your SDLC redesign** - explain how CircleCI orchestrates your solution

See `SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md` for the complete submission format.

### Prizes

Prizes to be announced - may include online learning memberships and gift cards!

## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing for Your Project

### Replace the Sample App

1. Keep the same file structure or add your own
2. Update `requirements.txt` with your dependencies
3. Update the test job in `.circleci/config.yml` to run your tests
4. Update the Dockerfile if needed for your application

### Add More Jobs

You can add additional jobs to the CircleCI pipeline:

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/python:3.11
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: pip install flake8
      - run: flake8 .
```

Then add it to the workflow:

```yaml
workflows:
  build-and-test:
    jobs:
      - lint
      - test:
          requires:
            - lint
```

## üéâ Ready to Build?

Remember: The goal is to **redesign the SDLC with CircleCI**. Think about:

- How can CI/CD improve development workflows?
- What manual processes can be automated?
- How can CircleCI orchestrate complex AI pipelines?
- What new SDLC phases are enabled by intelligent automation?

**Now go build something amazing!** üöÄ
