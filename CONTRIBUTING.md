This is a **starter** repository. The goal is simplicity, not feature completeness.

### Documentation
- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update README.es.md to match English changes
- Add comments to explain complex configurations

### Testing
- Test your changes locally first
- Verify CircleCI config validates: `./scripts/validate.sh`
- Ensure default configuration still works

### Code Style
- Follow existing patterns
- Use clear variable names
- Add comments for clarity
- Keep functions small and focused
